# The Passenger Archive

**The Passenger Archive** is a tool designed to help you curate your **personal music collection and ratings**, leveraging the vast [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) database for comprehensive metadata.

Primarily a command-line tool for use within the Python interpreter, it aims to let you:

* **Navigate** your local music library.
* **Search for, add, and remove** albums.
* Set your **personal star ratings** (1-5) for songs and albums.
* **Compare your ratings** to public averages (where available).
* **Mark if you own** specific albums.
* **Follow MusicBrainz links** for more detailed information, and more.

Think of it as a personal, powerful [**Rate Your Music**](https://rateyourmusic.com/) (RYM) experience, but entirely text-based and integrated directly into your Python environment.
